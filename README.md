# Dual access smallcell crosslayer optimization framework
## Summary 
We propose an energy-efficient self-organized framework for sub-channel allocation and power allocation for ultra-dense small cell network, which can operate in both licensed and unlicensed bands. In order to protect the legacy WiFi devices (operating in unlicensed bands), we consider LTE in unlicensed band based on carrier sense adaptive transmission, a technique in which 'ON' and 'OFF' duty cycle approach is utilized for harmonious coexistance of LTE and WiFi. On the other hand, there are severe interference management problems among small cells (operating in licensed bands) and between small cells (operating in licensed bands) and macrocells due to co-channel and ultra-dense deployment of small cells. In the light of these concernes, designing a self-organizing framework for sub-channel allocation and power allocation is a challenging task. We propose a self-organized optimization framework for sub-channels and power levels by utilizing a non-cooperative game with the concern of minimizing the energy efficiency of small cells without creating harmful impact on macro cell users, small cell users, and legacy wifi users, respectively.
